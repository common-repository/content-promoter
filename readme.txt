### Content Promoter Sections

* Selection
* Configure
* Publish Settings
* Previewer
* Preview

Below we can find more information for each of the above sections.

#### Selection
Select how many Promoting Content to display on your Promoting Item. Add up to 10 Promoting Content on each of your Promoting Items.
Set whether to display the first promoting content at the top of your post, page or set whether to display the last promoting content at the end of your post, page.

#### Configure
Select what Promoting Content to add to your Promoting Item. All available Promoting Items are described above.
Configure each of your Promoting Items to make them look and feel as you desire. Reordering allows you to change howy our Promoting Items appear on your site.

#### Publish Settings
Set where your Promoting Item will appear. You can select which posts, pages or custom post types you desire to display or not display a Promoting Item.

Additionally, you may select the method which will be used to display your Promoting Item.
Available methods:
* **MANUAL (default)** Add the Smart Tag {{CTPR_PROMOTING_ITEM}} where you want the promored content to appear in your post/page. Add as many tags as the the number of promoting items you created on the configuration step. Content Promoter will locate the Smart Tag and place the content there.
* **AUTO** Uses the Replacement Element to automatically place the promoting items after each found element. This works best with simple pages that only contain text and images. If your page is built using a 3rd-party page builder or contain complex layouts, you may not see a desired result, in this case, use the Manual mode.

##### Custom CSS & Javascript

This section allows you to add any CSS or JavaScript you desire and let it run alongside your Promoting Item. This helps you customize it even further using CSS to style it the way you desire.

#### Previewer
The previewer gives you a gist of how your Promoting Items will be positioned on your post, page. This is just a presentation and not the real placement of your Promoting Items.

#### Preview
Preview how your Promoting Items could appear in a real post, page by simulating it on a test post that is only visible to administrators. This allows you to ensure your post appears as expected prior to making it live to ensure its set as you desire and meets your expectations.

### Gutenberg Block
